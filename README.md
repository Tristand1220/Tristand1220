## Hi there 👋

I'm Tristan, a frontend developer based out of Atlanta, GA.

Most of my development work is spent designing, managing, and reconfiguring web-based user interfaces.

My primary tech stacks are react and typescript, paired with UI design such as Figma. I've been getting a lot of experience with Linux systems and firmware software (Arduino and Raspberry Pi)
