## Hi there 👋

I'm Tristan, a frontend developer based out of Atlanta, GA.

Most of my development work is spent designing, managing, and reconfiguring web-based user interfaces.

My primary tech stacks are React.js and Typescript, paired with UI design tools such as Figma. 

More of my recent projects have been centered around using Linux systems and firmware software (Arduino and Raspberry Pi) to create interactive UI dashboards for hardware projects
